# Fantasticfy_challenge

Disclaimer : This app is in charge of calling an Api and consumes the data it returns. 
It could have been build only with React, but in a challenge perspective, I chose to use Node.js as well
to show my skills in backend.

I am running into problems with robohash.org, that is supposed to provide the avatar pictures.
It takes a while to load. First I thought it was because of my app, but then I tried to call the endpoint
from postman and it takes ages to load ... 

I - Instructions
To make the app work, clone the repo and cd into each one of the subfolder (client & server)
When you're inside each folder, run npm install.

II - Make it run
To make the app run, you need to open each subfolder in a distinct terminal
Start by running the server by entering 'npm start'
Then the client with 'npm start' as well
